This is IEC61850-9.2LE Software Generator.

Software can generate different shapes of voltages and currents, with bunch of editable parameters - amplitude, frequency, phase. Moreover, it can generate arbitrary waveform by defining harmonics amplitudes and phases.

Additionaly this software can be used to control sampled values stream on any network port. It has decoding module (it's not so efficient, but works well).

# Recent information interlude

This code is well-outdated, but I am getting requests from people want to run it on modern OSes. So I spent a little time to make it compile and work for Win7/10/11 with Qt 5.12.12.

The code itself is ugly AF (I was a student), so I just made necessary changes for network adapters to power on and work.

sln files were updated to be working with VS 2022 and 141 toolchain.

If you just want to play around - get latest release archive.

Software ready to be launched on devices with sensor screens as it has virtual keyboard.

This tool also has some network-controlled parameters to remote control generation and signal params.

Additional information can be found in _documents folder.

Code have been being developed with Qt and Visual Studio (not needed to build). Using libpcap and qwt libs (included).
Note that it is not production-grade code, it's kinda handy tool for various manipulations with IEC61850-9.2. There is much C-like code in this masterpiece.

Works under Windows and Linux.

**Please note** this is an embedded software, so some settings looks weird. To use generator/capture you must tweak settings.ini - `macFront` and `macRear`. Also I am not sure whether it works on newer Windows versions.
